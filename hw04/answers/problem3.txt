I choose adjacency list, where each node is associated with a list of its children and the label of the edge.
I utilize hashmap to implement this. The advantage of this structure is that it takes short time to access the children and edges of a parent node. 
Also it only stores existing edges and nodes, so it is flexible and it saves memory.
For adjacency matrix, it is very quick to find out the edge that connect two given nodes.
For a collection of edges, it saves much more memory compared to adjacency matrix.
