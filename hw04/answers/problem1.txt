Overview: 
		The GraphWrapper is a mutable directed labeled mutigraph.
		No duplicate vertex is allowed, but duplicate edges are allowed.

	Abstract Function:
		The graph is stored as a multilayer map.
		There is a set of nodes in the first level of the map, with each node containing 
		a HashMap with set of its children as keys. 
		Each children maps to an array of all of the edges from the parentnode to the childnode. Every edges are labeled via the edgeLabels. 

	Representation Invariant:
		(g.nodes !=  null)
		&& (no nulls in keySet) 
		&& (keySet is not null)
		&& (value of keySet is not null)
		&& (no duplicate keys in keyset)
		&& (for all keys in keyset g.nodes.get(key).containsKey(null) == false)
		&& (for all keys in keyset g.nodes.get(key).keySet() != null) 
		&& (for all keys in keyset g.nodes.get(key).values() != null);
		&& (for all keys in keyset g.nodes.get(key).get(key in other keyset).contains(null) == false);
