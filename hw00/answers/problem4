4.1
The constructor and two member functions are set up incorrectly.
I add"this." in front of the private variables to distinguish it.
Get volume function should return volume.
Get color function should return color.

4.2
The first solution requires O(n) operation every time the getVolume() is called, and the second solution requires add/remove balls' volume
every time content changes. The second solution is better when the getVolume is called frequently.

4.3
First Way: Generate a sorted set when getBallsFromSmallest is called.
Second Way: Maintain a sorted set as private variable. The add and remove function would add/remove ball to\from the set each time when it is called.
The performance depends on the frequency of calling getBallsFromSmallest. If the function is called frequently compared to the add and remove function, then maintain a set would be better.
