    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This homework focuses on reading and interpreting specifications,
      and reading and writing Java source code. Additionally, you will
      be given an introduction to using <tt>checkRep</tt> methods and
      testing strategies. You will complete the implementation of a
      polynomial with rational coefficients, and you will answer
      questions about both the code you are given and the code you are
      going to write.</p>
    <p>To complete this homework, you will need to know:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Basic algebra (rational and polynomial arithmetic) and
        polynomial arithmetic </li>
      <li>How to read and write basic Java code

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>control structure: loops (<tt>while</tt> and <tt>for</tt>)
            and conditional branches (<tt>if</tt>, <tt>else</tt>)</li>
          <!-- <li>numeric type casts (the <tt>(double)</tt> operator) -->
        </ul>

    </ol>
    <h2 id="Problems">Problems</h2>
    <p> You should have files <tt>RatNum.java</tt> and <tt>RatPoly.java</tt>
      in directory <tt>src/main/java/hw3/</tt>, and files <tt>RatNumTest.java</tt>,
      <tt>RatPolyTest.java</tt> and <tt>RatPolyDivideTest.java</tt> in
      directory <tt>src/test/java/hw3/</tt>. (<tt>RatPolyDivideTest.java</tt>
      shows compilation errors because the division operation has not
      been added yet to <tt>RatPoly.java</tt>.) Read through the
      spcifications in <tt>RatNum.java</tt> and <tt>RatPoly.java</tt>
      to help you work through the problems below. </p>
    <h3 id="Problem-1">Problem 1: RatNum (5 pts)</h3>
    <p>For this first problem you don't have to write any code, but you
      do have to answer written questions. Read the specifications and
      provided implementation in <tt>RatNum.java</tt>, a class
      representing rational numbers. </p>
    <p>You may want to look at the code in <tt>RatNumTest.java</tt> to
      see example usages of the RatNum class (albeit in the context of a
      test driver, rather than application code).</p>
    <p>Answer the following questions, writing your answers in the file
      <tt>answers/problem1.pdf</tt>. <strong>Two or three sentences
        should be enough to answer each question. For full credit your
        answers should be short and to the point. Points will be
        deducted for answers that are excessively long or contain
        irrelevant information.</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <!--
<li>
Classify each public method of RatNum as a <i>creator</i>, <i>observer</i>, <i>producer</i> or <i>mutator</i>.
</li>
<li>
What is the point of the one-line comments inside the
<tt>add</tt>, <tt>sub</tt>,
<tt>mul</tt>, and <tt>div</tt> methods?</li>
-->
      <li> <tt>Classify each public method of RatNum as a creator,
          observer, producer or mutator.</tt></li>
      <li><tt>add</tt>, <tt>sub</tt>, <tt>mul</tt>, and <tt>div</tt>
        all require that "arg != null". This is because all of the
        methods access fields of 'arg' without checking if 'arg' is null
        first. But the methods also access fields of 'this' without
        checking for null; why is "this != null" absent from the
        requires-clause for the methods?</li>
      <li>Why is RatNum.valueOf(String) a static method? What
        alternative to static methods would allow one to accomplish the
        same goal of generating a RatNum from an input String?<br>
      </li>
      <!--
<li>
Why is <tt>RatNum.valueOf(String)</tt> a static method? What alternative to

a RatNum from an input String?</li>
-->
      <li><tt>add</tt>, <tt>sub</tt>, <tt>mul</tt>, and <tt>div</tt>
        all end with a statement of the form <code>return new RatNum (
          numerExpr , denomExpr);</code>. Imagine an implementation of
        the same function except the last statement is:
        <blockquote>
          <pre>this.numer = numerExpr;
this.denom = denomExpr;
return this;
</pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>For this question, pretend that the <tt>this.numer</tt> and
          <tt>this.denom</tt> fields are not declared as <tt>final</tt>
          so that these assignments compile properly. How would the
          above changes fail to meet the specifications of the function
          (Hint: take a look at the <tt>@requires</tt> and <tt>@modifies</tt>
          statements, or lack thereof) and fail to meet the
          specifications of the RatNum class?</p>
      </li>
      <li>Calls to <tt>checkRep</tt> are supposed to catch violations
        in the classes' invariants. In general, it is recommended that
        one call <tt>checkRep</tt> at the beginning and end of every
        method. In the case of <tt>RatNum</tt>, why is it sufficient to
        call <tt>checkRep</tt> only at the end of the constructors?
        (Hint: could a method ever modify a <tt>RatNum</tt> such that
        it violates its representation invariant? Could a method change
        a <tt>RatNum</tt> at all? How are changes to instances of <tt>RatNum</tt>
        prevented?) </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="Problem-2">Problem 2: RatPoly (34 pts: Code: 30 pts
      autograded, Answers: 4 pts)</h3>
    <p>Read over the specifications for the <tt>RatPoly</tt> class,
      making sure you understand the overview for RatPoly and the
      specifications for the given methods. Read through the provided
      skeletal implementation of <tt>RatPoly.java</tt>. </p>
    <p>Fill in an implementation for all methods.
      <!-- except for 
<code>differentiate()</code>, <code>antiDifferentiate(RatNum integrationConstant)</code>
and <code>integrate(double lowerBound, double upperBound)</code>. If implement you
these three methods you will earn 10 points extra credit for the assignment.
--></p>
    <p>You may define new private helper methods as you like.<!--; we have suggested
a few ourselves, complete with specifications, but you are not obligated
to use them. (We believe that doing so will simplify
your implementation.)--> You may not add public methods except for
      division; the external interface must remain the same. If you
      define new methods, you must specify them completely. You can
      consider the specifications of existing methods (where you fill in
      the body) to be adequate. You should comment any code you write,
      as needed; please do not over-comment. </p>
    <p>We have provided a <tt>checkRep()</tt> method in RatPoly that
      tests whether or not a RatPoly instance violates the
      representation invariants. We highly recommend you use <tt>checkRep()</tt>
      where appropriate in the code you write. Think about the issues
      discussed in the last question of problem 1 when deciding where <tt>checkRep</tt>
      should be called. </p>
    <!--<p>Take a look
at the RatPoly.degree() function for a simple way to include
<tt>checkRep()</tt> in your code.  Simply place the entire main body
of your code inside a <tt>try { ... }</tt> block, and append <pre>
finally {
    checkRep();
}</pre>
to your code.</p>
-->
    <p>There is a fairly rigorous test suite in <tt>RatPolyTest.java</tt>.
      You can run the given test suite with JUnit to evaluate your
      progress and the correctness of your code. It is probably a good
      idea to run tests individually rather than running the entire
      suite at once.</p>
    <p>Answer the following questions, writing your answers in the file
      <tt>answers/problem2.pdf</tt>. <strong>Remember, keep your
        answers to 2-3 sentences.</strong></p>

We have chosen the array representation of a polynomial: <code>RatNum[] coeffs</code>, 
where <code>coeffs[i]</code> stores the coefficient of the term of exponent <code>i</code>. 
An alternative data representation is the list-of-terms representation: <code>List&lt;Term&gt; terms</code>, where each Term 
object stores the term's RatNum coefficient and integer exponent. 
The beauty of the ADT methodology is that we can switch from one representation to

    <h3 id="Problem 3">Problem 3: Polynomial division (10 pts:
      Pseudocode, invariants and proofs: 5 pts, Java code: 5 pts
      autograded)</h3>
    <p> Write a pseudocode algorithm for division. State the loop
      invariant for the main loop and prove partial correctness. Write
      your answer in the file <tt>answers/problem3.pdf</tt>. </p>
    <p> When writing pseudocode use symbols +,-,* and / to express
      rational number and polynomial arithmetic. You may also use u[i]
      to retrieve the coefficient at power i of polynomial u, as well as
      c*x^i to denote the single-term polynomial of degree i and
      coefficient c. Important : write your pseudocode, invariants and
      proofs first, then write the Java code. Going backwards will be
      harder. </p>
    Use the following definition of polynomial division:
    <blockquote>
      <!-- <p>Division of polynomials is defined as follows:</p> -->
      <p>Given two polynomials u and v, with v != "0", we can divide u
        by v to obtain a quotient polynomial q and a remainder
        polynomial r satisfying the condition u = "q * v + r", where the
        degree of r is strictly less than the degree of v, the degree of
        q is no greater than the degree of u, and r and q have no
        negative exponents.</p>
      <p><b>For the purposes of this class, the operation "u / v"
          returns q as defined above</b>.</p>
      <p>The following are examples of div's behavior:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>(x^3-2*x+3) / (3*x^2) = 1/3*x (with r = "-2*x+3").</li>
        <li>(x^2+2*x+15) / (2*x^3) = 0 (with r = "x^2+2*x+15").</li>
        <li>(x^3+x-1) / (x+1) = x^2-x+2 (with r = "-3").</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that this truncating behavior is similar to the behavior
        of integer division on computers.</p>
    </blockquote>
    For the proof question, you do not need to handle division by zero;
    however, you will need to do so in the Java program.
    <p>Next, add a public method <tt>public RatPoly div(RatPoly p)</tt>
      with the appropriate specification to the <tt>RatPoly</tt> class
      and transfer your pseudocode algorithm into <tt>div</tt>. You may
      assume that the divisor <tt>p</tt> is non-null. If <tt>p</tt> is
      zero <tt>div</tt> returns some <tt>q</tt> such that <tt>q.isNaN</tt>.
      As with the other operations (e.g., <tt>mul</tt>), if <tt>this.isNaN</tt>
      or <tt>p.isNaN</tt>, <tt>div</tt> returns some <tt>q</tt> such
      that <tt>q.isNaN</tt> is true. </p>
    <p>There is an extensive test suite for division in <tt>RatPolyDivideTest.java</tt>.
      You can run this test suite to evaluate your progress and the
      correctness of your code.</p>

<h3 id="Problem-6">Problem 6: Invariant detection (4 points)</h3>

<p> Daikon is a software engineering tool that reports properties
about programs similar to representation invariants and method pre-
and postconditions.  Please read the <a
href="../../tools/daikon.html">introduction to Daikon</a>.  </p>

<p> For this problem, you will generate and analyze the results of
running Daikon on the <tt>RatNum</tt> class using two different test suites:
<tt>RatNumTest</tt>, the original test suite, and
<tt>RatNumSmallTest</tt>, a reduced test suite that does not provide as much coverage.</p>

<p> To ease your work, we have provided you with <tt>ant</tt> targets
to run Daikon with the correct arguments for this particular problem.
Like most of the other targets (e.g. "build"), these targets can be run from
either <a href="../../tools/editing-compiling.html#ant-eclipse">Eclipse</a> or the command line.
</p>

<p>First, run Daikon from your hw3 directory using the original RatNum test suite (<tt>RatNumTest</tt>):</p>
<pre>
ant daikon-RatNumTest
</pre>

<p>This command will place Daikon's results in
<tt>daikon-RatNumTest.inv.txt</tt> in your <tt>hw3</tt> directory.
If you are using Eclipse, you will need to refresh the <tt>hw3</tt> directory
to see the results file in the <b>Package Browser</b>.</p>

<p> Next, run Daikon on the reduced RatNum test suite (<tt>RatNumSmallTest</tt>):</p>
<pre>
ant daikon-RatNumSmallTest
</pre>

<p>This command will place Daikon's results in
<tt>daikon-RatNumSmallTest.inv.txt</tt> in the <tt>hw3</tt> directory.
If you are using Eclipse, you will need to refresh the <tt>hw3</tt> directory
to see the results file in the <b>Package Browser</b>.</p>

<p>Please answer the following questions in the file
<tt>hw3/answers/problem6.txt</tt>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Examine the representation invariants Daikon generates for
  <tt>RatNum</tt> using the original test suite.  These can be found at
  the top of the <tt>daikon-RatNumTest.inv.txt</tt> file under the
  heading <tt>hw3.RatNum:::OBJECT</tt>.  Does Daikon generate the same
  invariants that are recorded in the representation invariant of
  <tt>RatNum</tt>?  How do they differ?</li>

  <li>Compare the invariants generated by Daikon at the
  entrance of the <tt>RatNum.sub</tt> method (found under the heading <tt>hw3.RatNum.sub(hw3.RatNum):::ENTER</tt>), using the two different test suites.
  How are the invariants generated by the two test suites different?
  What do the differences tell you about the test cases that are
  missing from the reduced test suite for <tt>RatNum.sub</tt>?
  That is, what case is the reduced test suite not testing?
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
You should not commit any of the Daikon-generated files to your Subversion
repository.

      When you implement a method, you should be sure to remove the <code>throw

        new RuntimeException();</code> statement. For those of you who
      use Eclipse, we have also added a <tt>TODO:</tt> comment in each
      of these methods. The "Tasks" window will give you a list of all <tt>TODO:</tt>
      comments, which will help you find and complete these methods. </p>
    <p>Think before you code! The polynomial arithmetic functions are
      not difficult, but if you begin implementation without a specific
      plan, it is easy to get yourself into a terrible mess.
      Fortunately, you did write pseudocode for some polynomial
      arithmetic algorithms in Homework 2. </p>
    <p>The provided test suites in this homework are the same ones we
      will use to grade your implementation. In later homework
      assignments the staff will not provide such a thorough set of test
      cases to run on your implementations, you will be responsible for
      writing your test suites. For this homework you can consider the
      provided set of tests to be rigorous enough that <b>you do not
        need to write your own tests</b>.</p>
